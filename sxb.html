			<div class="body-text grid_10">
				sXb was a joint project between me and two other Xbox modding enthusiasts in 2005.
				It allowed Xbox owners to run a specially built Slackware distribution on their Xbox.
			</div>

			<div class="body-text grid_10">
				sXb turned the Xbox into a rather cheap server. It could do anything that Slackware
				did. You could run an FTP server, surf the internet on your TV using Firefox, chat
				on IRC using Xchat, write emails, watch movies, play music... anything!
			</div>

			<div class="body-text grid_10">
				Here's a screenshot of what one of the later sXb desktops looked like:

			<div class="body-text grid_10">
				One of my fellow teammates, 'Bollywood', did most of the low-level porting for
				Slackware onto the Xbox architecture. The other teammate did graphics for the website.
				I handled the administrative work and some of the Linux integration work. 
				I ran the website, forums, and handled public relations by promoting and providing help to users day and night.
				Along with the public relations, I helped 'Bollywood' compile, bundle packages, and tweak Slackware
				into the sXb release.
